# Clients

This repo contains clients I use to automate settling utilities.

# How to use it?

The clients are meant to be referenced via paket's [GitHub dependencies](https://fsprojects.github.io/Paket/github-dependencies.html) and used in an FSI (.fsx) environment.

# TODO

- consider better colorful logging - highlight xpath syntax
- add C# config tutorial
- add F# example
- add example using https://fsprojects.github.io/Paket/fsi-integration.html
- close clients when done, maybe implement IDisposable?
